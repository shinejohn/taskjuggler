## ⚠️ Remaining TODOs

### Priority 1: Backend API Endpoints

#### 1. URPA User Profile Endpoints
**Location:** `urpa-web/src/pages/Profile.vue` (lines 762, 785)

**Issue:**
- Profile page loads default data instead of fetching from backend
- Profile updates don't persist to URPA user profile table

**Required:**
```php
// Backend endpoints needed:
GET  /urpa/user-profile
PUT  /urpa/user-profile
POST /urpa/user-profile/upload-image
```

**Impact:** User profile data not persisted, image uploads not working

---

#### 2. Image Upload Endpoint
**Location:** `urpa-web/src/pages/Profile.vue` (line 807)

**Issue:**
- Image upload functionality not implemented
- Profile, avatar, and business logo uploads need backend support

**Required:**
```php
POST /urpa/user-profile/upload-image
// Should accept: type (profile|avatar|businessLogo), image file
// Should return: image URL
```

**Impact:** Users cannot upload profile images

---

### Priority 2: UI Improvements

#### 3. Integration Link Modals
**Locations:**
- `urpa-web/src/components/integrations/TaskJugglerWidget.vue` (line 78)
- `urpa-web/src/components/integrations/FibonaccoCRMWidget.vue` (line 75)
- `urpa-web/src/components/integrations/FibonaccoPublishingWidget.vue` (line 126)

**Issue:**
- Currently using `prompt()` for user input
- Should have proper modal dialogs with user/business/team selection

**Required:**
- Create reusable `IntegrationLinkModal.vue` component
- Fetch available users/businesses/teams from API
- Replace `prompt()` calls with modal

**Impact:** Poor UX, no validation, no search/filter capabilities

---

#### 4. Dropbox Save Integration
**Location:** `urpa-web/src/components/ai/ArtifactPanel.vue` (line 292)

**Issue:**
- Dropbox save is simulated, not actually saving to Dropbox
- Needs integration with Dropbox API via backend

**Required:**
```php
POST /urpa/artifacts/{id}/save-to-dropbox
// Should use existing Dropbox integration OAuth token
```

**Impact:** Artifacts cannot be saved to Dropbox

---

#### 5. Settings Card Configuration Persistence
**Location:** `urpa-web/src/components/settings/SettingsPanel.vue` (line 412)

**Issue:**
- Card visibility and configuration not saved to backend
- Changes are lost on page refresh

**Required:**
```php
GET  /urpa/user-settings/cards
PUT  /urpa/user-settings/cards
```

**Impact:** User preferences not persisted

---

### Priority 3: Code Quality

#### 6. SetupWizard Component Rendering
**Location:** `urpa-web/src/pages/SetupWizard.vue`

**Issue:**
- Uses `defineComponent` in computed property with `h()` render functions
- Complex nested component structure could be simplified

**Recommendation:**
- Consider breaking into separate step components
- Or use `<component :is>` with separate component imports
- Current implementation works but is harder to maintain

**Impact:** Code maintainability

---

## 🔍 Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. ✅ **TypeScript Integration** - Proper type definitions throughout
2. ✅ **Error Handling** - Try-catch blocks in async operations
3. ✅ **Component Structure** - Well-organized component hierarchy
4. ✅ **Store Management** - Proper Pinia store usage
5. ✅ **Real-time Updates** - Laravel Echo integration working
6. ✅ **API Integration** - Consistent API call patterns

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Component Size**
   - `SetupWizard.vue` is very large (948 lines)
   - Consider splitting into step components

2. **Code Duplication**
   - Similar form patterns repeated across components
   - Could extract reusable form components

3. **Error Messages**
   - Some error handling uses `console.error` only
   - Consider user-facing error notifications

4. **Loading States**
   - Some components lack loading indicators
   - Could improve perceived performance

## 📋 Testing Status

### Manual Testing Needed
- [ ] Profile page image upload
- [ ] SetupWizard OAuth flows (Google, Microsoft, Slack, Dropbox)
- [ ] Integration linking flows
- [ ] Dropbox artifact saving
- [ ] Settings persistence
- [ ] Subscribe page Stripe checkout flow

### Automated Testing
- ❌ No unit tests
- ❌ No integration tests
- ❌ No E2E tests

**Recommendation:** Add Vitest tests for critical flows

---

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

### Current Optimizations
- ✅ Virtual scrolling not yet implemented (mentioned in original review)
- ✅ Request cancellation not yet implemented
- ✅ Optimistic updates partially implemented
- ✅ Performance monitoring not yet implemented

### Recommendations
1. Implement virtual scrolling for ActivityFeed (if >100 items)
2. Add request cancellation for stale API calls
3. Add optimistic updates for better UX
4. Implement performance monitoring/metrics
