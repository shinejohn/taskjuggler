**SERVICE DESCRIPTION**

Version 2.0 | January 2026

**OfficialNotice.com**

*Share Documents. Track Deadlines. Never Miss What Matters.*

# **Executive Summary**

Official Notice is a secure document sharing and deadline management platform that connects attorneys with their clients. Attorneys create and share critical documents; clients receive them in a secure vault with automatic deadline tracking and notifications. Whether it's a commercial lease, a will, or immigration paperwork, Official Notice ensures documents are accessible to the right people and critical dates are never missed.

While attorneys are a primary driver of adoption, Official Notice works equally well for individuals and businesses managing their own documents without legal representation. Anyone can use it to organize personal leases, insurance policies, or any document with important dates.

| The Core Idea *Attorneys create documents. Clients need access. Deadlines matter. Official Notice connects all three.* |
| :---: |

# **How It Works**

| ATTORNEY Creates document | → | OFFICIAL NOTICE Stores & tracks dates | → | CLIENT Accesses & gets alerts |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

1. **Attorney uploads document** to Official Notice (lease, will, immigration papers, etc.)

2. **AI extracts critical dates** and key information automatically

3. **Attorney shares with client** who receives secure access to their document vault

4. **Both parties get notifications** as critical dates approach

5. **Client can add their own documents** like personal leases, insurance, and more

**No attorney required:** Individuals and businesses can also use Official Notice independently to manage their own documents and deadlines.
