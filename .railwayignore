# Prevent Railway from auto-detecting Node.js/Railpack
# This file tells Railway to ignore Node.js detection for the API service
# The API service should use NIXPACKS builder with Root Directory: taskjuggler-api

# Ignore root-level Node.js files that trigger Railpack detection
package.json
package-lock.json
node_modules
.npmrc

# Ignore root Procfile (if it exists)
Procfile
Procfile.*

# Only apply when Root Directory is NOT set (defaults to /)
# When Root Directory is set to taskjuggler-api, Railway will look there instead
